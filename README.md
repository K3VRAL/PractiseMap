## Installation

Before you can do anything with the project, you will need to [download and install libosu](https://github.com/K3VRAL/libosu).

You will also need to install `ruby` and `bundle`.

### For Linux:

Once you have the necessary tools and the library has been installed, in your terminal, while in the same folder location of this projects `pracmap.sh`, write `bundle install` to download the gems, then write `sh pracmap.sh install` to install the script.

If you wish to uninstall the program, do `sh pracmap.sh uninstall` to get rid of everything.

### For Windows:

Once you have the necessary tools and the project has been cloned, move the contents of the compiled `libosu.dll` project to the same folder location of this project's `pracmap.sh` file. You can now execute `ruby .\src\main.rb` to get the application running.
