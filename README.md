## Installation

Before you can do anything with the project, you will need to [download and install libosu.so](https://github.com/K3VRAL/libosu).

You will also need to install `gcc`, `make` and `pkg-config`.

Once you have the necessary tools and the library has been installed, in your terminal while still in the same folder location of this project's Makefile, write make, to compile the project to a binary, then sudo make install to install the binary.

If you wish to uninstall the program, do sudo make uninstall and that should get rid of everything.
